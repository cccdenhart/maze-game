# Maze Game

This project constructs a random maze that can either be attempted by the user or automatically solved.  Both breadth first search and depth first search are implemented in order to automatically solve the game.  This project was implemented for an academic assignment and relies on provided libraries (from the JARs) for generating the GUI and building tests. 

## Running Intstructions
* Run the main() method in the ./test/cdenhart.maze/ExamplesWorld.java file
* Goal: navigate from the top right corner of the maze to the bottom right corner
* Press "p" to enable player mode:
  - Use right, left, up, down keys to navigate
* Press "d" to display a depth first search result
* Press "b" to display a breadth first search result
* Press "a" to toggle between animating the result and instantaneously displaying the result

## Dependencies
* JDK 1.8.0
* Javalib -- for impworld library
